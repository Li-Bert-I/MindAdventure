At times we feel uncertain and confusion.... unsure of our next steps or direction... as if we are wandering in the darkness of an endless maze looking for a way out. But we can free ourselves from the captivity of our minds. There is a light within each of us - an Inner Light that holds the power to illuminate our path and guide us out of the darkness. However, we must heed its whispers and follow its gentle glow, lest we risk being forever consumed by the shadows
